# DesignPatterns


Materials for **Design Patterns** training course.
Its slides are in Turkish. I am planning to port them to English.

Examples written in Java are complete i.e. all patterns have example code in Java but for other langauges such as C#, C++, Python, etc they are not complete. I'll add new examples whenever I find time.

Please contact me at akin@javaturk.org for typos, suggestions and questions.
