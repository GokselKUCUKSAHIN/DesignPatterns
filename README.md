# DesignPatterns


Materials for **Design Patterns** training course.

Examples written in Java are complete i.e. all patterns have example code in Java but examples in other langauges such as C#, C++, Python, etc are not cpmplete. I'll add new examples whenever I find time.

Please contact me at akin@javaturk.org for typos, suggestions and questions.
